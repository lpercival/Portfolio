This was my final project for Accelerated Intro to Computer Science, which was
largely about learning C++. It demonstrates foundational programming topics such as
inheritance, polymorphism, multi-dimensional arrays, and dynamic memory allocation.
Plus the design of the robot objects that can be created and interacted with is
a bit fun.

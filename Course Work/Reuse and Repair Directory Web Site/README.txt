This was my portion of a term-long group project intended to provide information
on companies that do reuse and repair in the Corvallis area. The overall project
also included an Android application and Web API, but my teammate wrote the majority
of that code. This web site is the management portal that allows maintenance of
the data displayed by the Android application, namely viewing, adding, editing,
and deleting companies and categories, as well as authorized users for the web
site.

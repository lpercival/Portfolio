This was my final project for my Mobile and Cloud Development course. It consists
of an Android application that is supported by a Web API implemented in the Google App
Engine cloud provider using Python, which serves data from a non-relational Datastore
in JSON format. The intent of the application is to rank schools based on academic
reviews, which users can create, edit, delete, and view the ones they have written.

This was the final project for my Databases course. It is a web front-end for a
MySQL database that contains information pertaining to academic reviews. The data
includes a number of entities with multiple relationships, including some many-to-many
relationships and some structures that lead to complex queries. Interaction with
the database is done with PHP.
